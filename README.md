# USE: GIF IT

Click on GIF_IT_v_023.exe and the interface will open:
1. NAME IT: Create a new name for your GIF. It will automatically add the extension. Leave blank if you want to use the folder name for your GIF.
2. TIME IT: Choose the length of time for each frame in milliseconds (ms). 1 ms up to 100000 ms acceptable. A value of 1000 ms = 1 second per frame.
3. DISSOLVE IT: Choose how many frames you want to fade between each image. Alpha blend dissolve.
4. SIZE: Scale GIF output down to 0.1 or up to 10 times original size.
5. COLORS: Limit colors from a max of 256 down to 1 color.
6. OPEN IT: Open the GIF with the default appplication when finished.
7. DITHER OPTIONS: There are a few dither options that can be used for style and optimization they are ORDERED, RASTERIZE, FLOYDSTEINBERG, 8-BIT, or NONE. Leaving the setting on DITHER OPTIONS also = NONE.   
8. Click on the GIF IT button to select the folder containing the number sequenced images you want to convert. A file dialog window will open, allowing you to navigate to the desired folder. Select the folder and click "OK". 

OR

1. Drag and Drop your folder onto the GIF IT button and it will create a GIF file with the default TIME settings also if NAME IT is left blank it will use that folders name.

- That's it! GIF IT will start converting your images.

A progress bar will show 0 to 100% during image file collection. There may still be a few more moments for it to finish converting. 
Once complete, a status label will indicate "Great Success!" 
Your spanking new GIF file will be outside the folder you selected to convert.
Repeat the process as many times as you like by entering a new name, maybe adjusting the frame time, and then clicking the "GIF IT" button again or drag and drop another folder. 

- Happy animating :)
