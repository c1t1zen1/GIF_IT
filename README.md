# ABOUT: GIF IT

GIF IT will allow you to easily create a GIF animation from a folder of JPEG's or PNG files.
Folder preperations before using GIF IT appplication:
Name all image files sequentially i.e. "MyGIF_001.jpg, MyGIF_002.jpg, MyGIF_003.jpg, ...etc" 

Make sure you have the image files with the acceptable extensions (PNG, JPG, or JPEG) in the one folder for the conversion to work correctly. 
The images should all be the same dimension.

                                              
# USE: GIF IT

Click on GIF_IT_v_Beta.exe and the interface will open:
1. Input the new GIF name you desire into the NAME IT section. It will automatically add the .gif extension at the end of the process.
2. Change the speed of the animation. Choose the length of time for each frame in milliseconds (ms) in the TIME IT section. Values over 1 ms up to 100000 ms acceptable. A value of 1000 ms = 1 second per frame.  
3. Click on the GIF IT button to select the folder containing the number sequenced images you want to convert. A file dialog window will open, allowing you to navigate to the desired folder. Select the folder and click "OK". 

- That's it! GIF IT will start converting your images.

A progress bar will show 0 to 100% during image file collection. There may still be a few more moments for it to finish converting. 
Once complete, a status label will indicate "GIF Created successfully!" 
Your spanking new GIF file will be outside the folder you selected to convert.
Repeat the process as many times as you like by entering a new name, maybe adjusting the frame time, and then clicking the "GIF IT" button again. 

- Happy animating :)
